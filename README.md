# Ask Ah Seng: Making the Second Hand Car Market a better place # 

I recently tried to sell my car on a used car portal and I wasn’t happy with the exprerience. There wasn’t enough transparency, it was too slow, and I felt so much uncertainty in whether I could sell my car.

So I built a simple web app on which I deployed models to help a user determine a list price of a car, and the likelihood it could sell quickly.

The price prediction problem was not straightforward and there were many peculiarities of the Singapore car market I had to take into account. But I was glad I managed to apply most of the machine learning content here, ensemble methods and gradient boosting. I also had the joy of building my own dataset, and my own database to support an app, stretching my SQL skills to its limits.

I was also determined to go stretch my idea so that it could become a Minimum Viable Product that business owners could interact with. 

I'd love to get your feedback and thoughts on the project- ping me if you have any thoughts to add!
